      <p> Hello! We are a group of students at Columbia University working to bring 
      art history and art lessons to local schools and shelters to provide an 
      arts education for kids in our community. We are a 
      <a href="https://communityimpact.columbia.edu/">Community Impact</a> 
      organization. </p>
      <p> We are currently working in the Windham Center at 125th Street and the Regents 
      Shelter at 110th. If you are a local school or shelter interested in partnering
      with us, please contact us at artistsreachingout@gmail.com !</p>
